Project Overview:
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aimed to develop a machine learning system capable of accurately identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. This involved implementing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms to determine the most effective approach for fraud detection.

Technologies and Tools Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy
Key Responsibilities:

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
Applied stratified sampling to maintain the proportion of fraud and non-fraud cases in training and testing datasets, enhancing the evaluation process.
Model Development and Evaluation:

Implemented multiple machine learning algorithms:
Logistic Regression: Achieved 95.43% accuracy
Decision Tree Classifier: Achieved 90.86% accuracy
Random Forest Classifier: Achieved 94.42% accuracy
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Achieved 92.39% accuracy
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): Achieved 92.39% accuracy

Performance Metrics:

Evaluated the models using precision, recall, f1-score, and support to measure their effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.

Achievements:

Successfully developed a machine learning system capable of detecting fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.
Improved model robustness and accuracy through careful feature selection and data balancing.
Effectively communicated findings and results through detailed reports and visualizations, demonstrating the system's effectiveness in detecting fraud.
